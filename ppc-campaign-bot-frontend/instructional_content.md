## CPM (Cost Per Mille)
CPM stands for Cost Per Mille, or cost per thousand impressions. It is a metric used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage.

### Best Practices:

- Target highly relevant audiences to ensure that the impressions are meaningful.
- Monitor the number of actual clicks and conversions from CPM campaigns to evaluate effectiveness.

## CPC (Cost Per Click)
CPC stands for Cost Per Click and is the amount paid each time a user clicks on an ad.

### Best Practices:
- Optimize ad copy and landing pages to ensure high relevance and quality scores, which can lower CPC.
- Use A/B testing to find the most effective ad elements.
- Focus on high-converting keywords and ad placements to get the best return on your investment.

## ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)
ROAS measures the gross revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising. It is a metric that assesses the effectiveness of a digital advertising campaign.

### Best Practices:
- Aim for a ROAS that reflects a profitable margin after accounting for all costs.
- Use conversion tracking to accurately measure the return.
- Regularly review and adjust campaigns based on ROAS performance to optimize spend.

Remember, these metrics are interconnected. A successful PPC campaign will balance CPM, CPC, and ROAS to achieve the desired marketing objectives.
